[![CI](https://github.com/jolars/moloch/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/jolars/moloch/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

Moloch is a simple Beamer theme suitable for anyone to use. It is
a fork of the [Metropolis Theme](https://github.com/matze/mtheme).

The fork was created for the following reasons:

- To fix some outstanding issues that had not been addressed for a long time.
- To remove some of the more opinionated design choices, such as special handling of the Fira family of fonts.
- To strip away some features that added complexity to the code base without achieving valuable functionality for the majority of users, such as special code block designs and the pgfplots theme.

Do not expect this theme to be backwards compatible with the Metropolis theme.

## Installation

Moloch is on [CTAN](https://ctan.org/pkg/moloch), so you can install it using your favorite LaTeX package manager. For example, with `tlmgr`:

```sh
tlmgr install moloch
```

You can also install the theme from source, in which case you need a working LaTeX installation with `l3build` installed. Then just follow these steps:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/jolars/moloch.git
cd moloch
l3build install
```
